Recommender System Action Set
=============================

This directory includes programs for creating a recommender system with the 
recommend action set.  The action set is part of the SAS Viya 3.3 release and 
you must have access to a version 3.3 instance of SAS Cloud Analytic Services (CAS).

The programs are identical, except that one is written with CASL (CAS language) and the
other is written with Python.

The purpose of the programs is to demonstrate how to use the CAS actions to develop
experience with developing a recommender system with SAS Viya software.

Sample Data
-----------
The sample data for the example is the Book-Crossing data set. The data set includes
explicit ratings. The sample programs use the explicit ratings for developing the system.
The files can be downloaded from <http://www2.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/~cziegler/BX/>.

Data were used with permission from Dr. Cai-Nicolas Ziegler.  The following 
publication provides information about the dataset:
