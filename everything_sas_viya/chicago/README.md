Getting Started with SAS Viya Programming
=========================================

This repository provides files with data and SAS programs that are used
with the _Getting Started with SAS Viya Data Mining and Machine Learning_
documentation that is available from SAS.

The purpose for this repository is to help existing and future SAS Viya
customers to develop experience with the procedures and activities
that are part of data mining and machine learning programming.

To use the programming statements that are included in the
crime_data_models.sas file, you need access to a SAS Viya environment.
